If you’re on the hunt for Christmas presents, Huawei has you covered. The international technology giant’s range of earphones are for everyone: music lovers wanting great sound wherever they go, students listening to lectures online, and professionals conducting business meetings on the run. With their remarkable technological capabilities and beautiful aesthetic, the HUAWEI FreeBuds Lipstick and HUAWEI FreeBuds 4i are exceptional in every way. Take a look at what each offers before adding one to the list of gifts you want to get for family and friends – or even the list of gifts you want to receive yourself! The newly launched HUAWEI FreeBuds Lipstick, priced at R3,999, not only comes with an incredible audio experience, but also boasts a unique and striking appearance. Designed to look just like a stick of lipstick, the HUAWEI FreeBuds Lipstick is charming, fun, and sophisticated all at once. Its premium and minimalist case charges the earphones and looks like a luxury accessory that can be worn as a piece of jewellery. Designed by a team from Huawei’s aesthetic research centre in Paris, the HUAWEI FreeBuds Lipstick is made from corrosion- and heat-resistant stainless steel, giving it a smooth, sleek, and mirror-like exterior. Inside, Huawei has combined the bold luxury of the case’s black and gold with the glamorous red earbuds to create a striking design everyone will notice. The HUAWEI FreeBuds Lipstick is as impressive from a sound perspective as it is in terms of its aesthetics. In it, Huawei has combined industry-leading technology like active noise cancellation, AEM technology and a comfortable design to create a mind-blowing listening experience. Open-fit earphones offer a more pleasant wearing experience as you’re less likely to feel a build-up of pressure inside your ears. They also allow for better ventilation to balance your ear canal pressure, which means that you can wear them for hours without even noticing them. Through AEM technology, the headset automatically detects the shape of your ear canal and wearing conditions, and then assigns the EQ settings that will give you the best possible sound. The HUAWEI FreeBuds Lipstick supports three modes of EQ: balanced, bass boost, and treble boost. Switch between these options for a more personalised listening experience. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-90180 size-full" src="https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lipstick-Iconic-Design-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="800" srcset="https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lipstick-Iconic-Design-2.jpg 800w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lipstick-Iconic-Design-2-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lipstick-Iconic-Design-2-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lipstick-Iconic-Design-2-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lipstick-Iconic-Design-2-360x360.jpg 360w, https://www.destinyconnect.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Lipstick-Iconic-Design-2-600x600.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /> HUAWEI FreeBuds 4i The HUAWEI FreeBuds 4i, priced at R1,999, is packed with all the features you would expect from wireless earphones – and more. Like the HUAWEI FreeBuds Lipstick, the HUAWEI FreeBuds 4i sports active noise cancellation, a feature not often seen in earphones of this price range. The HUAWEI FreeBuds 4i uses built-in acoustic components and algorithms to generate inverted soundwaves. This technology allows the earphones to actively cancel out noise and offers a more immersive sound experience, whether you’re in a busy shopping centre, out on the street, or on noisy public transport. When active noise cancellation is turned off, the HUAWEI FreeBuds 4i can offer 10 hours of continuous music playback or 6.5 hours of voice call on a full charge. Together with the charging case, it can give you up to 22 hours of music playback or 14 hours of voice calls. And, with fast charging, the HUAWEI FreeBuds 4i can deliver four hours of listening pleasure from just 10 minutes of charging. The HUAWEI FreeBuds 4i comes with three sizes of soft silicone ear tips, allowing you to pick the right-sized tips for a sturdier and more comfortable wearing experience. And its oval-shaped and compact charging case is silky smooth on the front but flattened on the back, which ensures it sits easily on a flat surface. The charging case is also designed to fit neatly into your palm, so you can carry it around with ease. With Huawei, Christmas is under control.
